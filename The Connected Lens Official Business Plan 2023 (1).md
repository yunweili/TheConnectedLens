# <a name="_1flnfuzjgrm"></a>**Overview**
The Connected Lens has a set of ambitious plans for 2023. We intend to be able to expand and to target new audiences and reach even more immigrants when possible. The main purpose behind The Connected Lens is to provide immigrants an easier time to adjust to the environment at hand. 
# <a name="_3at9u9s4e0vp"></a>**Goals**
1. We aim to allow more immigrants to feel connected with the community around them and remove a lot of the language and cultural barriers that surround many people today. We believe a buddy is able to help them accomplish this by giving them somebody to talk and interact with in a similar background. 
1. We aim to help them with many of the basic necessities and integrations that are necessary to experience and live in the new culture including guides, new locations to explore, etc. that would otherwise be hard for them due to the language and cultural barrier. 
# <a name="_4p7xi5bvhxdr"></a>**Target Audience** 
For our service, we aim at immigrants and especially those who are affected by the language and cultural barrier due to the fact that we believe it is precisely those people who we are able to service and help the most. In the future, we might expand to new audiences, but at the moment, we intend to help immigrants due to their struggles in adjusting to their new environment with all the language and cultural barriers that hinge their development and integration overall. 
## <a name="_56kfpodyq5td"></a>Channels of Communication 
We aim to establish a variety of different channels of communication, including contact forms, and social media, in which we are able to answer any of the questions they may have. Another form of communication that we have set up is email, where they are able to email us with any concerns they may have. 

We aim to use the following channels of communication for the following purposes: 

**Contact Form**: We plan to use the contact form as a way to directly reach us with important questions, suggestions or comments regarding our service if the answers to a very specific question or scenario cannot be answered with either the guide, website or social media. We will respond to our contact form within 24-48 hours of submission by the user. 

**Social Media**: We plan to use social media (Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin) with the intention of communicating any announcements as well as offer a way to reach us directly through Direct Messages. This is intended for users who might have issues with the service and want to reach out to us directly but as well for users who want to keep us with new updates associated with our service that will be informed through the posts. 

**Email:** We plan to use email with the intention of communicating any messages or for those who sign up for our mail list. We also offer an option for individuals to email us with any problems or inquiries that they may encounter, and we will respond as soon as possible to their request and will offer quality help for every issue they encounter. 

**Github:** We plan to use Github with the intention of having a place where individuals are able to store all their resources that would be necessary and important for the use of our service, including the guide and business plan, as well as important resources and links to our services that would be important and relevant to our service. 

**Linktree**: We aim to use the Linktree as a place where they are able to find all the important links to the resources that are associated with our brand in case they are confused and can’t find it through our website. The Linktree is relatively easy to use and is very organized, providing a full context and picture for the user to get involved with the service and to prevent any confusion that could arise.

## <a name="_buwz1tcz7y35"></a>Buddy Matching 
The first step for any user is to fill out our buddy matching, from then we are able to use the information that is provided to us to find them a suitable mentor and send them the request for the mentor. Once our system finds a mentor that we deem to be a possible suit for the user, we will send them an email asking for their permission and whether they would like to connect with that specific buddy. From there, they have an option to either accept or reject the proposal, and if they accept, we will move to the next step, but if they decline, we will continue searching for a potential suit for their “buddy” and will continue searching until we find one that is satisfactory for the user. 
## <a name="_p2nityf5kx5q">Contact and Communication 
The second stage involves when the user accepts the “buddy request” and has a buddy assigned to them. From this step, we will often assign them a form of communication (Zoom, Meets, etc.) and we will exchange contact information as well as provide them with any assistance that may be necessary in ensuring they are able to communicate with each other. If they ever have any issues, they may request to drop their buddy, in which we will always honor without any questions. 

**Plans for Expansion** 

We intend to expand our services in the future, reaching more individuals, and overall building more features and possibilities with our service. One of the fundamental parts of this expansion involves adding new features, and we plan to add new services such as: 

**English Lessons:** 

One of this major reasons for this challenge in integration for many immigrants has to do with the language barrier that often restricts their ability to communicate with others, receive information and updates, etc. and thus we want to be able to address this issue by offering them English Lessons that would be tailored to their needs and would adjust with their strengths and weaknesses in order to ensure that they are able to communicate and be comfortable with it in many situations that may arise in their lives. We intend that this service to be completely free, and there is no time limit, meaning they are able to use the service whenever they have the time, and we believe that the flexibility would be very important due to the fact that they may be busy, and we won't want our service to be too big of a burden.  

**Interactive Activities:** 

One of the most useful activities that can help with breaking the language and cultural barrier is the use of interactive activities that develop both their language and cultural adaptation. We will offer a variety of interactive activities to assist them with learning English but also provide a variety of resources to help them adjust to the culture and be able to get involved in the community.
