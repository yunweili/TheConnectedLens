Information: 

The Connected Lens is a program that was founded with closing the language and cultural barrier of immigrants as they transition to the United States. Our online service allows individuals to connect to another individual of a similar culture and ethnicity, allowing them to bond together, making new friends and building connections that eases up the transition.

Introduction
The Connected Lens is a service intended to provide quality service and support to a variety of immigrants who are living in the United States that have trouble adjusting to the culture and thus have a hard time navigating everyday life. One of the most important and helpful tools in this situation is somebody to talk to, but often, they have very few connections in the community, and the language and cultural barrier often makes it hard for them to establish relevant connections. Many people are feeling this all over the United States, and thus we established The Connected Lens. The Connected Lens is a service that allows individuals of immigrant backgrounds to find “buddies” who can either be in their area or can be virtual that share a similar background to them, often having similar language or cultural identities, and thus are able to collaborate to make the transition as easy as possible.

Our Process

Our process involves a few critical and important steps that allows us to find a match when possible for the user based on the information that is given to us. The information includes age, location, culture, etc. as well as contact information to initiate the interaction once the user is matched with a “buddy”. After the user submits the form, our system will automatically notify the user through an email if there is a match that is going to be suitable for them, in which they have the option to accept or reject the connection based on their preferences. If they accept, we will set up a form of communication between them using a variety of communication platforms (Skype, Google Meets, Zoom, etc.) If they decline however, we will continue to search and will continue to notify them whenever we have a match. When they find a buddy that is suitable, we will set up a form of communication according to their preferences and will exchange contact information. From then on, the user is able to stay with their “buddy” for as long as they would like, and would be able to share information with each other if they choose. If they ever want to stop being a buddy with an individual, they may request that through the buddy dropout form, linked here: https://rb8lgb4waeb.typeform.com/to/COVS2ngB

Note: A user reserves the full right to drop out of any pairing, and we will always respect their decision, and based on their preferences, match them with a new buddy if they would like. However, if they want to reinstate the partnership in the future, both parties would need to agree.

Please note that the process for finding a buddy could take some time, as it is the job of us to make sure that there is a “buddy” that fits the profile and preferences of both users to stimulate the most effective communication. We cannot guarantee that a buddy can be found in a certain timeframe, but please be patient as we are constantly checking and trying to find any match that would be possible and notifying users when we find a potential suitor as soon as it gets found through email communication.
